From zero to production: this is the example code base for my "Single Page Applications with a Serverless Backend and Infrastructure as Code" tutorial.

It is an extensive guide which describes in detail how to create and deploy a React-based web app frontend using TypeScript and Redux Toolkit on top of a Node.js based AWS Lambda backend with a DynamoDB database, connect and integrate them through API Gateway and CloudFront, and explains how to codify and automate the required cloud infrastructure and deployment process using Terraform.
